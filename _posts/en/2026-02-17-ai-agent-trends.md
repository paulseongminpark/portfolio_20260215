## Who
Anthropic, OpenAI, Google DeepMind

## What
Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.6 ships 1M token context and multi-agent team capabilities. OpenAI announces Frontier enterprise agent platform with $200M Snowflake partnership.

## When
Week of Feb 10, 2026

## Why
The shift from single-LLM chatbots to role-separated multi-agent team architectures is accelerating. Agent orchestration layers are becoming essential infrastructure.

## How
Agent teams divide and collaborate on projects as workflows. Native integration with Snowflake data cloud enables agents to reason, analyze, and decide on governed data.

## So?
The middleware market is being reshaped into "agent orchestrators." Single-model API wrapper businesses are done.
